Personal modifications to VESTA that make nice(r) images.

To install, download elements.ini and place in the main VESTA directory where the executable is. Then download default.ini. This is
the style file and goes in the style/ (style\) folder located in the main VESTA directory. This is where changes you make and 'Save 
as Default' while in the program are written. I change nothing else so replacing the files with updates should be relatively 
painless.

The elements.ini file converts the VESTA color scheme which suffers a lot of same-color clashes (think N and F) to that of jmol, 
using code from https://prtkm.github.io/posts/changing-default-atom-colors-in-vesta-to-asejmol-colors/

Two examples are included (one with and one without hydrogens). Background is grayed slightly and hydrogens made a bit larger to 
help them stand out more. The gray background can be made transparent in Powerpoint or other software without interferring with 
atom colors.
